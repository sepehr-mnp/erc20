# erc20
ERC20 with solidity
this is an ERC20 contract and it uses the interface of ERC20
# compiler and deployer
i wrote the compiler and deployer of the contract with the latest changes of web3.js
you can log the module.export of the compile.js file and see the bytecode and ABI
the current deployer of the contract uses the rpc of goerli and you should put your private key in the code so deploy.js can use your account to deploy on goerli, dont forget that you should have some amount of goerli ether in your wallet to pay for the fee.
